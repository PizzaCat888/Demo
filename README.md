# Demo
My first blog site


This is a basic dynamic blog site centered around food. It includes basic features like CRUD, authentication, and authorization. 
It uses Bootsrap for most of the styling and several packages to make it work.This site was inspired by a project done in an online 
BootCamp and takes features from it while also being updated with various changes. In the future, this site may be updated with various
features such as FB authentication. 

Motivation:

This was one of my first projects and is meant to show what i can do. 

Installation:

Will include in the future.
